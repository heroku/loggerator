# LoggeratorRails automatically overrides Rails' log subscribers for controller
# handling with it's own log subscriber. The following is a simple method for
# turning this off, causing the default logging to be modified.
#
# Additionally, the line below could be added only to config/environments/development.rb
# to disable Loggerator's controller logging in development only.

#LoggeratorRails.use_default_subscribers!
